# Create_Grids
A simple script to make square grids (or, called fishnet) and hex grids with your shapefile (or other format if you modify the code) using shapely and geopandas packages. 

The present python script is just the raw version, which means I just clip and export the grids-creation part in the original script for (my) data process. So for more universal usage some changes may be added later.
